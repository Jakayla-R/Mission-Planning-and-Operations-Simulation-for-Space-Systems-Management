# Mission Planning and Operations Simulation for Space Systems Management 

This repository contains the source code, documentation, and resources for a mission planning and operations simulation developed as a project in space systems management. The project focuses on simulating the lifecycle of a space mission, from initial planning to operational execution, using advanced simulation techniques and methodologies.

Project Objectives:
To develop a comprehensive simulation model to replicate key aspects of space mission planning and operations.
Investigate mission architecture, trajectory optimization, resource management, and operational scenarios within the simulation framework.
Analyze simulation results to evaluate mission performance metrics and assess the feasibility of mission objectives.

Key Features:
Mission Concept Development: Define mission objectives, target destinations, and scientific goals for simulated space missions.
Trajectory Planning and Optimization: Design optimal trajectories and orbital maneuvers to achieve mission objectives and constraints.
Operational Simulations: Simulate mission operations including communication, navigation, spacecraft control, and resource utilization.
Data Analysis and Visualization: Analyze simulation results, visualize mission performance metrics, and interpret findings.

Repository Structure:
src/: Contains source code and scripts for implementing the mission planning and operations simulation.
docs/: Includes project documentation, simulation methodology, and research findings.
data/: Placeholder for simulation input data and sample datasets used in the project.
results/: Stores simulation outputs, analysis reports, and visualization tools.

Future Work:
Explore additional simulation scenarios and mission objectives to expand the scope of the project.
Enhance simulation models with advanced algorithms and techniques for more realistic mission simulations.
Collaborate with researchers and industry partners to validate simulation results and refine operational strategies.
